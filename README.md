# Python Coursework

A collection of Python projects from computer science coursework demonstrating
problem-solving, clean code, and core programming fundamentals.

## Overview
This repository contains multiple Python assignments completed as part of my computer science studies.
Each project focuses on applying fundamental programming concepts through structured and readable code.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python
- Control structures (loops and conditionals)
- Functions and modular program design
- Lists, dictionaries, and basic data structures
- Input validation and file handling

## Projects
### Assignment 1
Introductory Python program focusing on basic syntax, variables, and control flow.

### Assignment 2
Python program implementing structured logic and data handling based on defined specifications.

### Assignment 3
More advanced assignment emphasizing modular design and problem decomposition.

### Assignment 4
Comprehensive Python program combining multiple concepts into a complete solution.

## How to Run
Each assignment can be run independently from its directory:
```bash
python main.py
