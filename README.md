# Python Coursework Projects

A collection of Python projects completed as part of my computer science coursework.
These projects demonstrate problem-solving ability, clean code practices, and core
programming concepts, progressing from basic scripting to object-oriented design
and data analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)
- Functions and modular program design
- Lists, dictionaries, and structured data handling
- File input/output (CSV and text files)
- Object-oriented programming (classes and methods)
- Algorithmic problem-solving and validation

## Projects

### Assignment 1 – Gas Station Cost Calculator
A Python program that calculates the total cost of fuel based on user-selected fuel type
and litres entered. Emphasizes input validation and formatted output.

**Concepts:** dictionaries, conditionals, exception handling, user input validation  
**Run:** `python fuel.py`

---

### Assignment 2 – Wordle Game
A text-based Wordle-style game where the user has up to six attempts to guess a hidden word.
Provides symbol-based feedback and correctly handles duplicate letters.

**Concepts:** string manipulation, functions, nested loops, algorithm design  
**Run:** `python wordle.py`

---

### Assignment 3 – Olympic Medals Analysis
A data-processing program that loads Olympic host and medal data from CSV files and generates
formatted reports by country and by year.

**Concepts:** file I/O, CSV parsing, dictionaries, data aggregation, reporting  
**Run:** `python main.py`

---

### Assignment 4 – Blackjack Game
A text-based Blackjack game implemented using object-oriented programming. Supports multiple
rounds, computer decision logic, ace handling, and writes results to a text file.

**Concepts:** OOP, game loops, state management, file output  
**Run:** `python main.py` (or `python Game.py`)

## Notes
- All projects were completed independently as part of formal coursework.
- Code has been cleaned for public viewing and does not include grading artifacts.
